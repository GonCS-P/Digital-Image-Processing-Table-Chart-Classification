# Digital Image Processing - Table Chart Classification

## Project Overview

This project, conducted in 2018, focuses on the autonomous classification of images, particularly those containing table charts. The primary objective was to develop a digital image processing solution capable of automatically identifying and categorizing images with table charts from a given pool of images. This technology can be invaluable for data extraction, content indexing, and automation in various domains.

## Features

- **Deterministic Image Classification**: This project employs deterministic analysis techniques to autonomously classify images containing table charts based on pixel values and their structural characteristics.

- **High Accuracy**: Highly accuracurate and effective deterministic analysis approach in correctly identifying images with table charts.

- **Efficiency**: Ensures efficient processing of a large pool of images.
